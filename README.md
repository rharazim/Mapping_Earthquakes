# Mapping_Earthquakes

We created an interactive map to show up-to-date earthquake data from around the globe using Leaflet, the D3 library, GeoJSON data, and the Mapbox API. For the final challenge, we had to add tectonic plate lines to our map, add an overlay of all the major earthquakes, and add an additional tile layer map style for potential users to select.
